**Inspiration**
Recipeer was designed with two purposes in mind:

We wanted to encourage sustainability by reusing ingredients that would otherwise go to waste.
We also wanted to bring people together through food
What it does
Recipeer is a mobile app to make ingredients by combining recipes from you and your friends. After logging in, the user is prompted to upload a photo from their phone's camera roll, and AI scans the image for ingredients. The user's info and ingredients are used to create their profile, which they can use to connect with other people on the platform. Users can create events, where they can invite their friends and use AI to generate meal ideas based on the combinations of the ingredient each people has in stock.

**How we built it**
As Recipeer is designed as a mobile app, we developed the front end using React Native. For our backend, where we stored ingredients, recipes, and users, we used Convex. Finally, we used Gemini's API for AI calls, both for image transcription and as a text transformer.
